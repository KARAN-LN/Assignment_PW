        "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: This principle involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which helps to protect the integrity of the object's data. Access modifiers (public, protected, private) are often used to enforce encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction: Abstraction simplifies complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors an object should have. It allows programmers to focus on interactions at a higher level without needing to understand all the underlying details. Abstract classes and interfaces are common tools for achieving abstraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: This concept allows a new class (child class) to inherit the properties and methods of an existing class (parent class). Inheritance promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes. It can be single or multiple, depending on whether a class derives from one or more base classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows methods to be used interchangeably, even if the objects on which they are called are of different classes. This can be achieved through method overriding (same method name in derived classes) or method overloading (same method name with different parameters). It enables flexibility and the ability to define behaviors that can vary across different classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Composition: Composition involves constructing complex objects by combining simpler ones, rather than inheriting from a base class. This \"has-a\" relationship allows for more flexible designs and can lead to better separation of concerns. It emphasizes the use of objects to build functionality."
